By some stroke of luck, you've made your way here. The Ploopy Knob. Your life will never be the same.

This repository contains all of the design and production files necessary to make a Ploopy Knob. We've also included some kick-ass documentation on how to get it made, assemble it, and program it [which you can find here](https://ploopyco.github.io/knob/).

What are you waiting for? Your new life awaits.

## QMK?!

Knobs bought from the [Ploopy store](https://ploopy.co/product-category/knob) come with QMK preloaded. [Check out the documentation](https://ploopyco.github.io/knob/) for instructions on how to load new firmware onto your device. (It's super easy!)

The firmware file that ships with all Knobs is included in this repository as well, as `ploopyco_knob_slow.uf2`. We also have a few other precompiled firmwares, so try which one works best for you.

## Under what license is this released?

As per QMK's licensing requirements, the firmware for the Ploopy Knob is released under GPLv3. Hardware design files, including electronics and mechanical files, are released under OHL CERN v2-S. Check the respective directories for full license text.
