# Appendix C: Hardware

# Buying hardware from us

Getting all of the hardware on your own can be tricky because the parts you select may not fit perfectly. [That's why we sell fully-assembled Knobs](https://ploopy.co/product-category/knob/). Here's why that's great for you:

- Everything is guaranteed to fit together perfectly
- Everything is guaranteed to work as intended
- You'll end up saving money - probably quite a bit of money - by not spending on extra parts

Your call. You'll sort it out.

# Getting your own hardware

This guide was a bit light on detail in the other sections, and that's because the hardware has to conform to many specifications. They'll all be listed here.

First, a complete list of all the hardware you'll need:

- \#2 1/4" screws, x2
- 6mm diameter x 2mm thick magnet, x2
- 6705ZZ bearing
- 4x friction pads


We'll be going over all of them in detail. There will be mentions of *critical specifications*; if you're going to be sourcing your own parts, **you must get parts that conform to the critical specifications**. If you go off-menu, the parts will not fit the way that we intended when we designed the Knob. That might mean that your Knob **doesn't work**.

Let's get cracking.
