So, you want to build a Ploopy Knob, eh? Or, maybe you want to replace some broken parts. Maybe you want to reprogram it. Or maybe you just want to know how it all works. No matter the motivation, this is the place to learn.

**Sourced the parts and itching to get it built?** --> Get started by going to the [assembly instructions](assembly-instructions.md).

**Looking to purchase your own Knob?** --> [Check out the Ploopy store](https://ploopy.co/product-category/knob).

**Building a Ploopy Knob from scratch?** --> Get started by going to [Appendix A: Printed circuit boards](appendices/pcbs.md).
